# matchamatch 

## User Journey

Emma is a graduate student who recently developed a love for matcha but struggles to find good places beyond the one cafe she knows. She opens matchamatch after a friend's recommendation, creates an account, and sets her basic preferences for sweetness and strength levels. After granting location access, Emma lands on the Home screen showing an interactive map with matcha place markers around her area, including several she's never heard of like "Ten One Tea House." She taps on Ten One Tea House's marker and views the Place Detail screen showing photos, hours, price range, and preparation styles offered. Intrigued, she taps "Save" to bookmark it for later. One week later, Emma visits Ten One Tea House and tries their ceremonial matcha. Impressed by the strong, authentic flavor with minimal sweetness, she opens the app and navigates to the Log Entry screen where she rates it 5 out of 5 stars, adjusts the sweetness slider to 2 out of 5, sets the strength slider to 5 out of 5, and adds notes saying "Really liked it! Authentic and strong flavor, perfect preparation." She can upload a photo of the beautiful green tea if she wants to, and saves her log. When Emma's parents visit town, she opens her Collection screen to review her logged experiences. She filters her logs to show only her top-rated spots and confidently takes them to Ten One Tea House, her highest-rated place, explaining exactly why she chose it based on her detailed notes about the strong flavor and perfect preparation. matchamatch has transformed her from someone who knew one good place into a confident matcha explorer with a personal guide to her city's best options.

## API Configuration

The application is configured to communicate with the backend at `http://localhost:8000/api`. This is set up in:

- `vite.config.ts` - Proxy configuration for development
- `src/services/api.ts` - API base URL and typed endpoints

To change the backend URL, update the `API_BASE_URL` in `src/services/api.ts`.

All API endpoints are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces defined in `src/types/api.ts`.

## Backend API

The application expects the backend to implement the API specification defined in `API_SPEC.md`. All endpoints use POST requests and return JSON responses.

### Main API Modules:

- **ExperienceLog** - Create, update, and manage matcha experience logs
- **PlaceDirectory** - Manage matcha places and locations
- **UserDirectory** - User registration and preferences
- **RecommendationEngine** - Personalized place recommendations

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in `src/components/`
2. Add new views in `src/views/`
3. Update routes in `src/router/index.ts`
4. Add API methods in `src/services/api.ts`
5. Define types in `src/types/api.ts`

### State Management

User authentication state is managed using Pinia in `src/stores/user.ts`. The user ID, display name, and email are persisted in localStorage. The store is fully typed with TypeScript.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed to a static hosting service.
